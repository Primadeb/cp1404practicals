# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?


Initially, my estimates were often overly optimistic. I underestimated the time required for debugging and testing

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I gained more experience with the tasks, I became better at identifying the complexity of requirements and adjusted my estimates accordingly. My accuracy improved steadily.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned to account for unknowns and potential challenges, to break tasks into smaller steps, and to buffer extra time for testing and debugging.


## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned new techniques and approaches to solving problems, as well as the importance of writing clear and maintainable code. Constructive feedback also improved my attention to detail.



### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me understand common mistakes and best practices. It also improved my ability to communicate technical feedback effectively and encouraged critical thinking about design choices.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would introduce a short collaborative project midway through the subject to encourage teamwork and peer learning.


### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I stayed consistent in completing tasks on time, thoroughly tested my code, and made an effort to document my solutions clearly for future reference.
